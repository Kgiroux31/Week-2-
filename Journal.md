"With  millions  of  popular  media  stories  posted  on  social  media  featuring burial grounds and monuments (Figure 1), and taphophile cyber-communities and crowd-sourced web archives of cemeteries from around the world, personal grave markers can easily ‘go viral’" (Katherine Cook). 
This week proved both a sucess as well as a challenge. To begin with, the Auld Kirk United cemetery is open to the public and was easy to access. When I set out the morning I recorded the gravestones, I was a bit nervous to get started for the only reason that I worried about any ethical issues I would run into. Almonte is a fairly small town that is community based and I worried about recording historic graves when distant family members could still visit. However, once I arrived and began recording the gravestones, my view on the subject changed. 
It was something my mother said that changed my mind. We were looking at the grave to commemorate Edwin K. Aitken when she said "I wonder if anyone ever comes to look at these graves." Her comment made me think more about his grave and how appreciative I was to be surveying it.
