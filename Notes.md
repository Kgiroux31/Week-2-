This week was a bit more difficult than the last, but also proved to be very rewarding. Some challenges I ran into were choosing the right cemetery to visit which would have historic graves as well as choosing which headstones to begin recording. I ended up deciding on the Auld Kirk United Cemetery on Wolf Grove Rd. going into Almonte. The section closest to the road is historic and has many graves where families have inscribed the names of their sons who died in France during the First World War. Seeing as this is my main interest in Canadian history, I knew the Auld Kirk United Cemtery would prove succesful in my recordings. 
The Auld Kirk United Cemetery is a very large cemtery and would therefore prove impossible to record the entire space. The back end of the cemetery is most recent while the section that looks onto Wolf Grove Rd. is much more historic. While this section contains more historic graves, it is still quite spacious so I still had to narrow my recording to a much more focused area.
